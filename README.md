## Tips/Run

* Run `rundll32 sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables` in PowerShell, under PATH in System variables add the "bin" directory-path for where the 'mongod' service is located (e.g. C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin)
* Run the `mongod` command to initiate a CLI version of the mongo
* I ran into TypeScript problems early on executing SQL within JavaScript on mongod/mongo, switched the project to SQL Server instead...
